    "# Fourier Transform Explained Using Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! The **Fourier Transform (FT)** can be understood elegantly using **linear algebra**, particularly in terms of **vector spaces, basis transformations, and eigenvalues**. Hereâ€™s how:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Fourier Transform as a Change of Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, we often describe vectors in terms of **basis vectors**. A function (or a signal) can also be seen as a vector in an infinite-dimensional vector space. The **Fourier Transform** is simply a change of basis from the **time domain** (or spatial domain) to the **frequency domain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis in Time and Frequency Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the **time domain**, we typically represent signals using **standard basis vectors** (impulses or samples at discrete time points).\n",
    "- In the **frequency domain**, we represent signals using **complex exponentials** (sines and cosines), which form an **orthonormal basis** for this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the Fourier Transform expresses a function \\( f(t) \\) as a sum of basis functions of the form \\( e^{-i 2\\pi \\omega t} \\). This is analogous to representing a vector in terms of a new basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Fourier Transform as a Matrix Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete signals, the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** is a matrix transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "F_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f_n e^{-i 2\\pi kn/N}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be written in **matrix form** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{f}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) is the **vector of Fourier coefficients** (frequency domain representation).\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{f} \\) is the **vector of signal values** in the time domain.\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{W} \\) is the **DFT matrix** with entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  W_{kn} = e^{-i 2\\pi kn/N}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DFT matrix** \\( \\mathbf{W} \\) is a **unitary matrix**, meaning that its inverse is just its conjugate transpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathbf{W}^{H} \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{I}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the transformation preserves information and is invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Fourier Modes as Eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DFT matrix** has **eigenvectors** that are exactly the Fourier basis functions (complex exponentials). This means that applying the Fourier Transform to these eigenvectors simply scales them by an eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Fourier basis** consists of the columns of \\( \\mathbf{W} \\).\n",
    "- Any signal can be decomposed into these basis functions, meaning that in the frequency domain, the signal is represented as a sum of scaled eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to **diagonalization in linear algebra**, where a matrix is rewritten in terms of its eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Convolution as Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful result from Fourier analysis states that **convolution in the time domain** corresponds to **multiplication in the frequency domain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix terms:\n",
    "- Convolution can be seen as multiplying the signal by a **Toeplitz matrix**.\n",
    "- Taking the Fourier Transform diagonalizes this Toeplitz matrix, making convolution much easier to compute as simple **element-wise multiplication** in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the **Fourier Transform speeds up convolutions** and is widely used in **signal processing and machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Fourier Transform** is a **change of basis** using complex exponentials.\n",
    "- The **DFT matrix** transforms time-domain vectors into frequency-domain vectors.\n",
    "- The **Fourier basis vectors** are **eigenvectors of the shift operator**.\n",
    "- **Convolution in time** corresponds to **multiplication in the frequency domain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **linear algebra perspective** makes Fourier analysis more intuitive and computationally efficient! ðŸš€\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Demonstration of the Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we demonstrate the **DFT matrix operation** and compare it to the **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**.\n"
