2P6: Signal Processing and Data Analysis
University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering

Lecturer: Flavia Mancini

📌 About This Repository

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for students enrolled in the 2P6: Signal Processing and Data Analysis course at the University of Cambridge. The notebook provides an interactive learning environment to explore key signal processing concepts through practical Python implementations.

🔹 What You Will Learn

This notebook will help you:

✅ Generate and analyze signals (chirp, sine wave, aliased chirp, and music signals).

✅ Understand the Fourier Transform and its applications.

✅ Visualize signals in the time domain and frequency domain.

✅ Compute and interpret spectrograms for time-varying frequency content.

✅ Save and play signals as WAV audio files.

🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/2P6_fourier.git
cd 2P6_fourier

2️⃣ Set Up the Python Environment

Ensure you have Python installed and then install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, if you're using Jupyter Notebook, install dependencies inside the notebook:

!pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sounddevice

3️⃣ Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the file:

jupyter notebook notebooks/2P6_Signal_Processing.ipynb

🛠 Features & Implementations

📌 Signal Generation

Sine Wave: A fundamental periodic signal used in signal processing.

Chirp Signal: A signal whose frequency increases or decreases over time.

Aliased Chirp: Demonstrating aliasing effects due to low sampling rates.

Music Signal: Processing and analyzing an audio file.

📌 Signal Visualization

Waveform Representation: Visualizing signals in the time domain.

Fourier Transform (FFT & DFT): Computing frequency components.

Spectrogram Analysis: Time-frequency visualization of signals.

📌 Saving and Playing Audio

Save generated signals as WAV files.

Play signals directly within the notebook.
