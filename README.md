**2P6: Signal Processing and Data Analysis**
University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering

Lecturer: Flavia Mancini

📌 About This Repository

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for students enrolled in the 2P6: Signal Processing and Data Analysis course at the University of Cambridge. The notebook provides an interactive learning environment to explore key signal processing concepts through practical Python implementations.


🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/flamancini/2P6_fourier.git
cd 2P6_fourier

2️⃣ We are using Jupyter Notebooks, please install dependencies inside the notebook:

!pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sounddevice

3️⃣ Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the file:

jupyter notebook notebooks/2P6_Signal_Processing.ipynb


🛠 Features & Implementations

📌 FFT_demo.ipynb
This notebook will help you:
Generate and analyze signals (chirp, sine wave, aliased chirp, and music signals).
Understand the Fourier Transform and its applications.
Visualize signals in the time domain and frequency domain.
Compute and interpret spectrograms for time-varying frequency content.
Save and play signals as WAV audio files.

📌 Fourier_Transform_Linear_Algebra.ipynb
This notebook will help you understand the Fourier Transform from a linear algebra perspective, including concepts like basis transformations, eigenvalues, and matrix operations. It demonstrates the DFT as a matrix transformation and compares it with the FFT, providing an intuitive and computational approach to signal processing. 🚀
